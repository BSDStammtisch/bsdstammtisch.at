## Agenda
- Reports
	- What has happened since the last Stammtisch? (MacLemon)
  - We have [something like a website](/).
  	- The old wien. and graz. hostnames are automatically redirected to the main site
  - We have a [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) account: [@bsdstammtisch](https://twitter.com/bsdstammtisch)
  - We have a [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/about) account on a BSD focused instance. [@BSDStammtisch@bsd.network](https://bsd.network/@bsdstammtisch) (Mastodon is opensource, federated, awesome and friendly better Twitter)

## Main Talk
- Ansible for freeBSD (Luto)
  - we failed hard: https://github.com/criecm/ansible-iocage because the iocage Plugin for Ansible is in need of some attention.
  - Luto is the ansible guy, MacLemon the BSD guy, so they combined their efforts to get stuff (almost) working
  - Time ran away from Luto, so he shows us ansible basics

### Ansible basics:
- Get [Ansible Information](https://www.ansible.com/ "Ansible is simple IT automation")
- Read [Ansible Documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ "Ansible Documentation")
- Read [Ansible on BSD](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/intro_bsd.html)
- To install Ansible on your FreeBSD controller system you can use the port [sysutils/ansible](https://www.freshports.org/sysutils/ansible/ "ansible Radically simple IT automation")
First install Ansible on the machine that pushes the update, the machine to be installed doesn't need anything. Create a file called "inventory" in the directory you want to configure the ansible connection (which basically opens a ssh connection and does awesome stuff with that). 

Controller machine needs python (preferably 2, 3 should be also supported by now)
Controlled machine also needs some kind of python (versions don't need to match)

FreeBSD has no python installed by default, so you need to install this yourself on the controlled machine and tell ansible where to find it there (as ansible comes from the Linux world and BSD puts python in another place).

Ansible configuration files are written in [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML "Wikipedia: YAML Ain't Markup Language")

There is an [Ansible module for ZFS](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/zfs_module.html "zfs - Manage zfs") which you can use to create datasets, change ZFS properties.

- Show and Tell (Everyone): Briefly show us a practical tool that helps you solve a problem. (Anything goes! Web, CLI, GUI, Services, Literature, Podcasts, Recepies, etc.)
