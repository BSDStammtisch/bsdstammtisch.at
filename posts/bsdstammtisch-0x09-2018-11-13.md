- Got a topic you'd like to present on? Please do!

- [FreeBSD 10.4-RELEASE] reached [End of Life Status](https://www.freebsd.org/security/unsupported.html) on 2018-10-31.
- [FreeBSD 12](https://www.freebsd.org/news/newsflash.html#event20181110:01) is coming (At BETA 4 at the time of this writing.)
- Book: [Absolute FreeBSD, 3rd edition](https://nostarch.com/absfreebsd3) (No Starch Press), by [Michael W. Lucas](https://www.tiltedwindmillpress.com
- BSD powered high-availability gummib√§rl√§mpchen talking to hardware using BSD and one-wire and some random hacks
OneWire is a serial like protocol that requires *two* wires and is designed for up to three wires. With a USB to OneWire Adapter you can control the relays which turn on and off the bears.
Goal is to run [RTEMS](https://www.rtems.org/) on a [GRiSP Board](https://www.grisp.org/specs/) which is used to run [Erlang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_(programming_language)) applications on a realtime operating system. The GRiSP board sports a FreeBSD network stack, so networking is stable and performant.

There's also [Jenkins integration](https://wiki.jenkins.io/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=20250625) for the ‚ÄúRed Bear alert‚Äù.

- [Geek and Poke](http://geek-and-poke.com/) Webcomic on [Best of both worlds](https://geekandpoke.typepad.com/.a/6a00d8341d3df553ef0120a830136e970b-pi) regarding statically typed languages. In General *Geek and Poke* is recommended reading for any sysadmin or developer.

Build your own [Gummibear Server](https://hackmd.io/s/B1WM_3_pm#)!

Inspired? Have a look at more [Blinkenlights](http://blinkenlights.net/blinkenlights) projects!
