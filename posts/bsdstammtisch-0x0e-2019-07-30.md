Thanks to [SBA Research](https://www.sba-research.org/) for hosting us!

## Attendance ðŸŽŸ
Free for all people interested in learning or discussing about all things BSD! You are welcome!


## Topics
### Building a container infrastructure based on FreeBSD Jails with Ansible
Nowadays container technologies like Docker are the first thing you here when the question on how to deploy and manage (micro) services. However, FreeBSD already has lots of features out of the box that can be used to implement lots of the wanted characteristics, but there is still a need for glue code to integrate it into a complete solution.


### Show and Tell
Any interesting problems or solutions you have encountered recently? Please share your experiences, so we can all benefit!

- Zammad 3.0 cannot be deployed on FreeBSD anymore, because libv8 doesn't build on FreeBSD.

## Shownotes
We do have a [Pad for collaborative note taking](https://pads.c3w.at/code/#/2/code/edit/XYwio2kiPkmDnlUG5UeglGg-/)
